###  🔬 What I learned

Overall, this challenge was more about practicing **CSS Grid** rather than learning the fundamentals. However, I did face a new challenge with designing the tablet version of the layout, which I handled on my own. While the design itself was relatively simple, it gave me the opportunity to experiment with creating a **masonry-style two-column layout**, which was a fun problem to solve and added an interesting dynamic to the design.

In addition to this, I used **SCSS** for the styling, a tool I was already familiar with. Although I had previous experience with SCSS, this project allowed me to reinforce my skills and improve my workflow. I also had the chance to update my knowledge on best practices for organizing and structuring SCSS files, especially when it comes to using **variables**, **mixins**, and **nested selectors** for better maintainability and clarity.
